  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in

  uses-material-design: true
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: Metropolis
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Metropolis/Metropolis-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Metropolis/Metropolis-SemiBold.otf

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  #   #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  # fonts:
  #   - family: Cantarell
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Cantarell-Regular.otf
  #   - family: EuclidCircular
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Euclid_Circular_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #       - asset: fonts/Euclid_Circular_SemiBold.ttf
  #         weight: 600
  #       - asset: fonts/Euclid_Circular_Medium.ttf
  #         weight: 500
